        The Prolific Woman Trybe (TPWT) is a global community of high-achieving
        women committed to personal evolution, professional excellence, and
        collective empowerment. Founded by Bethel Ehikioya, a Nigerian speaker,
        author, and entrepreneur, TPWT was born from a vision to help women
        unlock their full potentialâ€”beyond societal roles, limitations, or
        expectations.
